# Project Progress: System Sound Manager with MCP Support

## Tasks

- [x] Task 1: Project Setup
- [x] Task 2: Logging Setup
- [x] Task 3: Core Windows Sound Functions
- [x] Task 4: Profile Management
- [x] Task 5: Sound Manager Class
- [x] Task 6: Basic CLI
- [x] Task 7: MCP Implementation
- [x] Task 8: Advanced Features
- [x] Task 9: Documentation & Examples
- [ ] Task 10: Refinement

## Decisions

- Using standard library `logging`.
- Using standard library `json` for config and profiles.
- Using standard library `winreg` for registry access.
- Using standard library `winsound` for playing sounds (initially).

## Notes

- Need to identify the correct registry keys for system sounds.
- Need to investigate libraries for more advanced audio control (volume, device switching).
- MCP context detection will require libraries to monitor active windows or system events (e.g., `psutil`, potentially platform-specific APIs like `pywin32`).
